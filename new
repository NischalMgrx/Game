Second Generation of computer.             Third generation of computer
1. The second generation (1956-1963) was   1. The third generation computers 
   the era of the transistor computer.        used integrated circuits (ICs)  
                                              instead of transistors.
2. It made transistor computers faster     2. These were much more efficient than 
   than the first generation computer.        the second generation computer.
3. One transistor consists of two diods.   3. One IC consists of 1 to 1000 
                                              transistors.
4. Core memory was developed.              4. Integrated circuits were developed.
5. Machine Language and Assembly Language  5. High Level Language were used.
   were used.
